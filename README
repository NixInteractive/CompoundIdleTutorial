#Compound Idle Tutorial

This code is for those following my Compound Idle tutorials. The code is split into folders based on which video they go with. This is intended to be used to check your code against mine for errors.

This code isn't perfect and is constantly being changed so if you encounter any bugs or have any questions, comments, or suggestions please feel free to reach out to me on Discord: https://discord.gg/JGqheYN5wH

I hope this code is useful for you. Good luck!

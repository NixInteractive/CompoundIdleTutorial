In this video we wrote the code that will spawn in our generators. This will make it so all we need to do is put in the numbers for the different parameters and let it run!

It would be cool to create a custom editor script where you can type this stuff in and hit create and it will add the new generator to the list. I have no idea how to use custom editors though so that's a project for a different day or a different dev.
